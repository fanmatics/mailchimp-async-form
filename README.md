Mailchimp's embedded signup forms open up new tabs. We want users to stay on our site after they click the subscribe button. All you need is your Mailchimp User and List id. Install via npm, include the js/css, add a small block of HTML wherever you need the embedded signup field — et voilà. Done.

## Install
```js
npm i --save mailchimp-async-form
```
Then include `mailchimp-async-form.js/mailchimp-async-form.css`.   
Insert the embedcode from `embed.html`, making sure to replace `{uid}` and `{listId}` respectively.
